# PolarProjection

Perspective projection makes the edges longer than center. It creates a bad experience on 3D vision on screen due to the object sizes changes when we turn our around.

I developed a projection method named Polar Projection to solve this problem. I am using spherical sensor instead of plane sensor.

But, in spite of Polar Projection preserves the object size, it can't preserve the stright lines. Lines bend on edge like fish eye.
